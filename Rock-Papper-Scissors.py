"""
This is a very common game and despite its underlying complexity, 
the gameâ€™s rules are straightforward. 
Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, with the outcome determined by these three rules:

Rock wins against scissors.
Scissors win against paper.
Paper wins against rock.

This is achieved while a player enters a choice and python randomly chooses using the random module.
